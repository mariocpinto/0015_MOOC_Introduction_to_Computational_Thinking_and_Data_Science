### Lecture 2: Simulations and Random Walks

* [Random Walks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FylxGyUzB7g)
  * Simulations attempt to build an experimental device called a model. Simulations are descriptive and not prescriptive.
  * Simulations can be classified as:
    * Deterministic v/s stochastic.
    * Static v/s dynamic.
    * Discrete v/s continuous.
