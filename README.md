# 0015_MOOC_Introduction_to_Computational_Thinking_and_Data_Science

This repository contains [course notes](Course_Notes.md) for the edX MOOC [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computational-thinking-data-mitx-6-00-2x-3). This MOOC is a follow-up course to [Introduction to CS & Programming using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-6).

This repository is also intended to showcase the work I did while completing this MOOC - My [course completion records](Course_Completion.md) are included in this repository.

Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/mariocpinto/0000_Lists/blob/master/MOOCs_and_Tutorials.md) to access notes of other courses I have taken.
